            <p>
              Orders can be placed through our website, via WhatsApp, by phone, or in person at our studio.
              By placing an order, you confirm that:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
              <li>You are at least 18 years old, or ordering on behalf of a registered business</li>
              <li>You own or have permission to use any artwork, logos, or designs submitted to us</li>
              <li>The information you provide (contact details, delivery address, design specs) is accurate</li>
              <li>You understand that custom-printed items cannot be returned for refunds once production begins</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Orders are confirmed once payment is received. We reserve the right to refuse any order that
              violates these terms, contains illegal or offensive content, or that we are unable to fulfil.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section number="3" title="Pricing and payment">
            <p>
              All prices are in <strong>Kenyan Shillings (KES)</strong> and include VAT where applicable.
              Prices shown on our website are for standard specifications. Custom requirements (sizes, finishes,
              quantities outside standard tiers) may incur additional charges, communicated via a quote.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">We accept the following payment methods:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>M-Pesa</strong> — via STK push on your registered Safaricom number</li>
              <li><strong>Card payments</strong> — Visa and Mastercard via IntaSend</li>
              <li><strong>Bank transfer</strong> — for orders above KES 50,000</li>
              <li><strong>Business credit</strong> — 30-day terms for approved business accounts</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              All payments must clear before we begin production. Failed payments will result in cancelled orders.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section number="4" title="Production and turnaround">
            <p>
              Turnaround times listed on each product page are estimates based on standard production. We start
              the clock once we receive your final, approved design.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Same-day printing</strong> — available for select products, when ordered before 12 PM and the design is ready</li>
              <li><strong>Standard turnaround</strong> — 1 to 4 business days depending on the product</li>
              <li><strong>Custom or bulk orders</strong> — turnaround communicated in your quote</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Delays may occur due to design revisions, payment processing, public holidays, or unforeseen
              technical issues. We will communicate any delays as soon as possible.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section number="5" title="Design submission and proofs">
            <p>
              You are responsible for providing print-ready artwork in the formats we accept (PDF, AI, PSD, PNG, JPG)
              at a minimum of 300 DPI with the correct dimensions and bleed.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              For every order, we send a <strong>digital pre-print proof</strong> by email. You must review and
              approve this proof before production begins. By approving the proof, you accept:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>The artwork as it appears in the proof</li>
              <li>Any spelling, layout, or colour issues you may have missed</li>
              <li>That we are not liable for errors approved by you</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              We offer a <strong>physical proof service</strong> (KES 500, credited to final order) for orders
              above KES 30,000 — allowing you to inspect the actual print before bulk production.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section number="6" title="Delivery and collection">
            <p>We offer the following delivery options:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Studio collection</strong> — free pickup from our Westlands, Nairobi location during business hours</li>
              <li><strong>Nairobi delivery</strong> — KES 450, or free on orders over KES 7,000</li>
              <li><strong>Nationwide delivery</strong> — KES 850 via trusted courier partners, or free on orders over KES 7,000. Typical delivery time is 2–4 business days</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Delivery dates are estimates and not guaranteed. We are not liable for delays caused by courier
              services. Risk of loss transfers to you once items leave our premises with our courier partner.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section number="7" title="Reprint guarantee and refunds">
            <p>
              We stand behind every job. If your order arrives <strong>damaged</strong>, contains a{" "}
              <strong>printing error caused by us</strong>, or differs from the approved proof, we will{" "}
              <strong>reprint it at no charge</strong>.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">To claim a reprint, contact us within <strong>48 hours of delivery</strong> with:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Your order reference</li>
              <li>Clear photos of the issue</li>
              <li>A description of the problem</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              <strong>Refunds:</strong> Because all items are custom printed to your specifications, we generally
              do not offer cash refunds. Where a refund is required (e.g. order cancelled before production),
              it will be processed to your original payment method within 5–7 business days, less any non-recoverable
              fees such as design work already completed.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              <strong>We are not liable</strong> for issues caused by: incorrect information you provided,
              errors in your supplied artwork, colours appearing different on screens than in print (RGB vs CMYK),
              or approval of proofs containing the error.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section number="8" title="Intellectual property">
            <p>
              <strong>Your artwork stays yours.</strong> By submitting designs to us, you grant us a limited
              licence to use them solely for the purpose of fulfilling your order.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              You confirm that you own or have permission to use any logos, images, fonts, or designs you submit.
              You are responsible for any copyright or trademark issues arising from your artwork. We reserve the
              right to refuse jobs that appear to infringe third-party rights.

          <Section number="9" title="Cancellations">
            <p>
              You can cancel an order within <strong>2 hours</strong> of placing it, before it enters production,
              for a full refund. Once production begins, we cannot cancel the order — but you can still claim a
              reprint if the final product has issues.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              We reserve the right to cancel any order at our discretion, with a full refund, if we are unable to
              fulfil it for any reason (e.g. material shortages, equipment failure, illegal content).

          <Section number="12" title="Limitation of liability">
            <p>
              To the maximum extent allowed by Kenyan law, our total liability for any order is limited to{" "}
              <strong>the amount you paid for that order</strong>. We are not liable for indirect losses such
              as lost profits, lost business opportunities, or consequential damages.

            <p className="mt-3">
              Nothing in these terms limits liability for death, personal injury caused by our negligence,
              or fraud — where Kenyan law does not allow such limits.
